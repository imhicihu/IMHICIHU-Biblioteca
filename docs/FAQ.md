### FAQ
* Since `IMHICIHU-Biblioteca` will not generate no revenue, at this time we will not take on the additional expense of paying for [Apple and Microsoft developer accounts](https://www.appypie.com/faqs/how-much-does-a-googleapple-developer-account-cost). This means we can't distribute our app through the official Apple/Microsoft stores, and we can't sign or get the app verified either.
* Check the SHA256 hashes of the downloaded `zip` files, and compare them against the ones listed on this page. This will, at least, ensure the binaries are the ones we built. On Mac & Windows (with GitBash) you can use this command:
`shasum -a 256 IMHICIHU - Biblioteca.app.zip`
* Run the binary through a virus scanner. Windows 10 has Windows Defender built-in.
* Run it through an online virus scanner. We recommend [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).
