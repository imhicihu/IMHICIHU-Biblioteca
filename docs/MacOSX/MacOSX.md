* If you get a warning that `IMHICIHU-Biblioteca.dmg` can't be opened due to an unidentified developer you have to make sure that under `System Preferences` > `Security & Privacy` > `General` it is allowed to open apps from the `Mac App Store and identified developers`. Then try to open `IMHICIHU-biblio-searcher.dmg` and under `System Preferences` > `Security & Privacy` > `General` click on `Open Anyway`.
