### Security Policy

To report or disclose a potential security-related issue in this open-source project, please email the details to `imhicihu` at `gmail` dot `com`. Please include the following information, as much as possible:
```
1. Summary of the issue and its potential impact.
2. Versions affected (optional).
3. Technical details and proof of concept (where applicable).
4. Known mitigations / workarounds.
5. Attribution information.
```
We will respond to valid security disclosures and provide security fixes on the next release of this open-source project.

> [!WARNING]
> Code Signing Certificates has not yet been integrated with the builds for macOS. This means that (and probably a couple of anti-virus programs) will flag the `IMHICIHU - Biblioteca.app` installer as untrusted. `IMHICIHU - Biblioteca.app` will however run fine if you proceed despite the warnings.
